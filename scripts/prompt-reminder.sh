REMINDER:
- Check CLAUDE.md (plan first, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID, simplicity & maintainability)
- TDD workflow: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
- Update memory-bank if context has changed
- Self-checking and verification before coding
- Check if tests are running in background, target 80% coverage
- Use context7 MCP if available, always check docs before implementing
